This repository contains the code for a CI/CD pipeline that deploys a WordPress application. The pipeline uses GitHub Actions to automate the following steps:

- Checkout the code from the repository.
- Install dependencies.
- Run tests.
- Build the application.
- Deploy the application to a production environment.

The pipeline is configured to run on every push to the repository. This ensures that your application is always up-to-date and that any changes you make are deployed to production immediately.

To learn more about how to use the pipeline, please see the README file.
